                    <h2>Brotherton Library</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Brotherton Library is Leeds more traditional looking library, located inside the Parkinson building. The steps are often busy at lunchtime with its close proximity to many of students favourite sandwich shops. There is a piano in the entrance of the building waiting for people to play, a large hall, and then the library itself. The library is a 1936 Grade II listed Beaux-Arts building, the grandeur of the building making it a perfect study spot to feel inspired.
